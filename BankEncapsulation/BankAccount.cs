//Create a new public class named BankAccount
//In your BankAccount class, create the following:
//A private field of type double named **balance** with a value of 0
//Define a method named Deposit that will accept a double and store that value in the balance field
//Define a method named GetBalance that will return the amount stored in the balance field
//In the main method of your application, create a new instance of the BankAccount class. Allow the user of the application to Deposit money and retrieve their balance through the console.
//Once finished save, commit, and push back to Github
